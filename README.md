I am building an offline app that acts like miro, I like miro but I can't create as much projects as I want to + there's no offline support. This will be a macOS first app.

## Plans

### Phase 01

❌ Create an infinite canvas<br/>
❌ Create a macOS like experience<br/>
❌ Make the editor be able to create basic shapes and create diagrams out of it<br/>
❌ Create a minimap<br/>
❌ Be able to save the project<br/>
❌ Be able to export the project as PDF, IMAGE, Web<br/>
❌ Attach documents like pdf, videos, audios<br/>


### Phase 02

❌ Create a project manager<br/>
❌ Create a Projects UI like in figma<br/>

## Phase 03

❌ Attach a local AI assistant like we have on zed editor<br/>
