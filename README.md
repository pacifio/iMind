I am building an offline app that acts like miro, I like miro but I can't create as much projects as I want to + there's no offline support. This will be a macOS first app.

## Plans

### Phase 01

1. Create an infinite canvas
2. Create a macOS like experience
3. Make the editor be able to create basic shapes and create diagrams out of it
4. Create a minimap
5. Be able to save the project
6. Be able to export the project as PDF, IMAGE, Web
7. Attach documents like pdf, videos, audios


### Phase 02

1. Create a project manager
2. Create a Projects UI like in figma

## Phase 03

1. Attach a local AI assistant like we have on zed editor
