## iMind

I am building an offline app that acts like miro, I like miro but I can't create as much projects as I want to + there's no offline support. This will be a macOS first app.

## Plans

### Phase 01

☑️ Create an infinite canvas
☑️ Create a macOS like experience
☑️ Make the editor be able to create basic shapes and create diagrams out of it
☑️ Create a minimap
☑️ Be able to save the project
☑️ Be able to export the project as PDF, IMAGE, Web
☑️ Attach documents like pdf, videos, audios


### Phase 02

☑️ Create a project manager
☑️ Create a Projects UI like in figma

## Phase 03

☑️ Attach a local AI assistant like we have on zed editor
